# Week 11: Final Project Brainstorm
Start thinking and brainstorm an idea for the final project!

## Synopsis:
I think I want my final project to be about water and scarcity. I was experimenting with this idea with Processing and Arduino. This was what I created thus far.

- the knob is made so that the bucket will move horizontally across the screen 
- each drop collected will make the blue LED light up

- I decided to add a timer and a point system to track the number of drops collected
