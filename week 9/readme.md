# Week 9: Analog and Digital Sensors
To get creative with analog and digital sensors!

## Synopsis:
Our assignment was to create and get information from at least one analog sensor and at least one digital sensor, then to use this information to control at least two LEDS - one in a digital fashion and the other in an analog fashion.

## What I did:
I started this project by reviewing a lot of the theory and practical information from class. 

- step 1: 
Before attempting this project, I made sure that I could create a circuit with an analog sensor and a digital sensor separately. After a few practices, did I only start combining the two on the same breadboard.

- step 2: 
I decided to draw up a schematic because I found this really helpful during class for me to visualize the flow of electricity throughout the circuit.

- step 3:
I began to start building the circuit with the wires, LED, breadboard, LDR, switch and arduino.

- step 4: 
On Arduino

## Outcome
My final outcome is this video: TAN_UnusualSwitchFinal.mp4 - which you can find in the 'week 9' folder!

## Challenges
The biggest challenge for me over this project is understanding the functionality of the breadboard and trying to imagine the flow of electricity from arduino to the breadboard. I also found it difficult to come up with a creative and unusual switch. Because it was difficult for the wires to touch each other, I had to find sheets of metal that I wrapped around the coil to make sure that it has a greater surface area and sensitivity. 

## Reflections
The shift from coding to electricity is a bit of a jump for me. This last week has been a little challenging in class too. I know I can always freely ask questions in class too, but sometimes I feel like I'm not sure what I should be asking or what I might be missing out. I do enjoy the hands-on work that we do in class and my favorite part is uploading arduino code and seeing the LED light up. I found it very amusing when I was building my circuit for the unusual switch - happy that I could take something I do in my everyday life and incorporate it.
