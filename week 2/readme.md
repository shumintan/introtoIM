# June 2: Assignment 2

## Synopsis:

The task was to create a piece of art that used for/while loop and other code from the syntax we learned so far. 

## What I did:
I started my artwork with some of the basic animation and loops that we practiced this week. 
- step 1: 
I experimented with an animation where I coded white vertical lines appearing across the screen.
