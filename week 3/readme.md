# Week 3: Art Project 2
## Synopsis:
Our assignment was to create an Object-Oriented Programming. Paying attention to structure, clarity, and organization of the program.
## What I did:
To complete this task I decided to play around with arrays that we learned in class. 
- step 1:
I first started by rewatching the assignments that we worked on in class with arrays (e.g. with the balls) and experimented there. 
I watched this extra video on Arrays to help my undersatnding: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NptnmWvkbTw. I then changed the balls to lines:

- step 2: 
Then, I decided to add the additional shapes and lines which was language that I was more familiar with.

- step 3: 
Next, I tried to play with rotation and Object-Orientation from the videos we were assigned in class, so I decided to try add window wipers (like what you would see from a car window). 
..... But it failed - absolutely horrendous, so I decided to change it into a windmill. :)

## Outcome
Tadaa!

## Challenges
The process for this assignment definitely took longer time to figure out. There was a lot of trial/error with arrays and with translations/rotations. I find it incredibly difficult to create a mental image of what I want my code to look like. Oftentimes, I would  have a fixated image/artwork that I have in mind, but it turns out otherwise! This assignment has taught me that artwork can be created when we go with the flow too. So flexiblility is key!

## Reflections
I found this assignment, again, very fun and frustrating!!
Fun, because I am starting to get to grips with coding language. I am more comfortable and confident with the format and structure of code. 
Frustrating, however, because I had to spend extra time on the trial/error process with arrays and object-orientation. Am glad that I finally could produce artwork that I am happy with.
